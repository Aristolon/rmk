Keyboard firmware with layer/dynamic keymap/[vial](https://get.vial.today) support, written in Rust.

> RMK is under active development, breaking changes may happen. If you have any problem please check the latest doc or file an issue.

## News

- [2024.03.07] BLE support with auto-reconnection/multiple devices feature for nrf52840 has beed added to RMK! Checkout [boards/nrf52840_ble](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/boards/nrf52840_ble/src/main.rs) for details.

- [2024.02.18] Version `0.1.4` is just released! This release contains a new [build script](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/boards/stm32h7/build.rs) for generating vial config, minor API update and a brand new [user documentation page](https://haobogu.github.io/rmk).

- [2024.01.26] ðŸŽ‰[rmk-template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template) is released! Now you can create your own keyboard firmware with a single command: `cargo generate --git https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template`

- [2024.01.18] RMK just released version `0.1.0`! By migrating to [Embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy), RMK now has better async support, more supported MCUs and much easier usages than before. For examples using Embassy, check [`boards`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/tree/main/boards) folder!

## [User Documentation](https://haobogu.github.io/rmk/guide_overview.html) 

## [API Reference](https://docs.rs/rmk/latest/rmk/)

## Prerequisites

This crate requires stable Rust 1.75 and up. `openocd`(stm32) or `probe-rs`(stm32/rp2040) is used for flashing & debugging.

## Usage

### Option 1: Initialize from template
You can use [rmk-template](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template) to initialize your project.

```
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate --git https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk-template
```

### Option 2: Try built-in examples

Example can be found at [`boards`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/boards). The following is a simple
step-to-step instruction for rp2040 and stm32h7

#### rp2040

1. Install [probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs)

   ```shell
   cargo install probe-rs --features cli
   ```

2. Build the firmware

   ```shell
   cd boards/rp2040
   cargo build
   ```

3. Flash

   ```shell
   cd boards/rp2040
   cargo run
   ```

#### stm32h7

1. Install [openocd](https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd)

2. Build the firmware

   ```shell
   cd boards/stm32h7
   cargo build
   ```

3. Flash

   You can use both `probe-rs` and `openocd` to flash the firmware: 

   ```shell
   # Use openocd
   openocd -f openocd.cfg -c "program target/thumbv7em-none-eabihf/debug/rmk-stm32h7 preverify verify reset exit"
   
   # Use probe-rs
   cd boards/stm32h7
   cargo run
   ```

4. (Optional) Debug firmware using CMSIS-DAP

   Open the project using VSCode, choose `Cortex-Debug - stm32h7` debug profile, then press `F5`, the firmware will be automatically compiled and flashed. A debug session is started after flashing.
   Check [`.vscode/tasks.json`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json) and [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) for details.
