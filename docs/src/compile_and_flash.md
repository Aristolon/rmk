# Compile and flash!

In this section, you'll be able to compile your firmware and flash it to your microcontroller.

## 1. Compile the firmware

To compile the firmware is easy, just run

```shell
cargo build --release
```

If you've done all the previous steps correctly, you can find your compiled firmware at `target/<your_target>/release` folder.

If you encountered any problems when compiling the firmware, please report it at [https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk](https://github.com/HaoboGu/rmk)
