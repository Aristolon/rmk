# Overview

This guide introduces how to build your own keyboard firmware using RMK. There are 3 sections of the guide:

- setup the RMK environment

- create a RMK project

- compile the firmware and flash

After completing the all 3 section of the guide, you'll learn how to create your personal keyboard firmware using RMK and make it run on your real-world hardware!

## Before we start

Using RMK requires basic knowledge of **Rust programming and embedded devices**. If you're not familiar with Rust, [The Official Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a good start. And if you're not familiar with embedded Rust, we recommend you to read [The Embedded Rust Book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/) first. We'll keep working on making RMK more accessible for everybody.
